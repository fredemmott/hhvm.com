HHVM 4.118 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.112;
HHVM 4.113&ndash;4.117 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- added HHI for `ext_facts`; when using the watchman-based autoloader, this
  provides information about the declarations in the current repository.

# Breaking Changes

- `Stringish` is now sealed to `StringishObject` and can not be directly
  extended. Any class implementing `__toString(): string` automatically
  implements the `StringishObject` interface.
